**Why did I want to become a developer?**
Traditional methods are so 90s. Once I saw how research chould be simplified with technology, I knew I was turned forever. I want to build cool things that enhance the day-to-day life. 

**Why me?** 
Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises. I possess a combination of interpersonal and technical skills that have been built upon in my background in sales, as a digital consultant and educational achievements.

##About me

After studying Digital Humanities at Masters level, my first career was in International Sales. During this time, I sought advice on how I could hone the coding skills that I began developing at University in order to change career to what I always wanted to do. 

Since then, I have been working as a Digital Consultant for <a href="https://www.dmu.ac.uk/home.aspx">De Montfort University</a> and studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>. Here, I have been learning the fundamentals of software development by emulating popular social media sites (like <a href="https://github.com/katieljones/acebook-dreambook-2020">this one</a>), a clone of Facebook. My experience at Makers helped me to develop best practices such as unit testing, TDD, clean code, OOP and DRY. Even more so, I discovered my interest in mobile development, more specifically, Swift which I learned and implemented into my final project in 6 days.
 
**What am I doing while on the jobhunt?**<br>

Since graduating Makers, I am volunteering on a project for Age UK, Hammersmith. This involves enhancing their web interface and database management system to help save employee's time.

Other than this, I am working on a personal project of mine using Rails and improving my Swift proficiency.

## SKILLS

#### Adaptable and Resilient

When working in sales, I had the great opportunity to work and live in Switzerland for 6 months. Before the secondment started, I prepared in advance as much as possible. For example, I calculated comparisons of the average cost of living compared to London, I analysed the placement logistically, I even brushed up on my basic German skills. All of the above ensured that I would encounter minimal, unexpected situations and helped me to negotiate where necessary. Though I made a conscious effort to prepare beforehand, it became apparent that the real adapting would come when I arrived. I made an enormous amount of effort to understand the local culture and adjust to a different work lifestyle. After a couple of weeks, I built positive relationships with colleagues and they even told me that "I fitted in right away" despite the cultural differences.

#### Analytical

Since I can remember, I have always been known as the person who questions the reliability of sources and thoroughly explores every detail until I simply can't anymore. I would analyse traditionals methods to see if I could think of preceeding ones. I have demonstrated analyst traits when:

- At my most recent role, I drove messaging improvements by creating a global tender response document to ensure all countries became aligned in their responses. This came about when during my different placements, I noticed that different documents and information were sent out to clients and thus came to the conclusion the company should have one voice to come across more professional. 

- At university, I wrote a computer program in Python with no coding knowledge or experience because my first way would have taken longer than time left on the course. My project proposal was to analyse derogatory terms levelled towards women in 30 early modern plays. Traditionally, this would mean I would need to note every single term with the naked eye after reading all of the plays and then re-read them to tally the amount of times they appeared. Not even with my quick reading would I have even got round to reading them, let alone completing my other modules. My professor looked at me in bemusement -- *until* I put forward the idea of writing a computer program that would count them for me. A year of reading turned into a couple of week by the magic help of my Mac!
